\chapter{What to do next}
In addition to doing rasterization experiments, you can go on and explore the following core topics in Computer Graphics for the rest of your life. Iâ€™ve omitted many topics here, but studying these will help you reach them.

\section{Graphics Techniques (2D)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Drawing Primitives
    \item Clipping Primitives
    \item Transformations and Viewing
    \item Alpha, Transparency and Compositing
