\chapter{Introduction}
This book guides you through the step-by-step construction of a CPU based software rasterizer and is expected to be an introduction to real-time 3D graphics programmng. Prerequisites are: C++ and Mathematics ( Trigonometry, Co-ordinate Geometry and Linear Algebra ).  

After finishing the book you will have a clear understanding of how real-time 3D engines work since we mainly go through the topics viz., Transformations, Viewing, Projection, Clipping, Rasterization, Texturing, Lighting, Shading and Depth Buffering. And that knowledge will help you while learning graphics APIs, rendering engines and game engines. 

The sample code of each chapter is availabe at

You are requested to try out your own solutions to each problem in the upcoming chapters. 
Please make sure  you read the primer chapter first.
