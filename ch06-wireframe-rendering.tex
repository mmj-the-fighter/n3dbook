\chapter{Wireframe Rendering}
\section{Problem}
The scene and interaction is the same as the previous chapter except that the output we need is the outline of the triangles in the model.
\section{Solution}
We have to modify the Mesh::LoadMesh(...) so that we can load points and triangles. Also, we need to modify the Rasterizer::RenderMesh(...) so that the loop in it iterates triangles. In the last step, edges of the triangle are drawn using DrawLine(...) function available in the framework.

\section{The pipeline}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Get updated model matrix
    \item Get updated matrices from camera
    \item Concatenate Projection, View and Model matrices (PVM)
     \item Do the following for each triangle in the mesh
    \item Pre-Multiply the triangle vertices with PVM matrix
    \item Clip each triangle to get clipped list
    \item For each clipped triangle do the following
    \item Do perspective divide
    \item Do viewport transformation
    \item Draw lines connecting the vertices in the screen space
\end{enumerate}

\section{Clipping}
The clipping process is like we discussed in the primer chapter. When we interpolate the vertices, we only interpolate position.
